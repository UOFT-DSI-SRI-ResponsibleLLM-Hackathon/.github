# Responsible LLM Hackathon: Leveraging AI for Collaborative Solutions

Welcome to the Responsible LLM Hackathon! In this event, you will work together with your teammates and leverage large language models (LLMs) as collaborative team members. The theme focuses on human-AI collaboration to design efficient, interdisciplinary solutions that promote responsible AI usage.

## Theme: Responsible AI in Collaboration

### Your task for the hackathon is:
- Utilizing diverse LLM tools and techniques during different stages of the design and development process for various tasks.
- Developing and deploying an application or system that incorporates at least one AI-driven component.

### The goals are:
- Exploring innovative and responsible applications of LLMs in building intelligent systems.
- Understanding the current landscape of LLMs and shaping the future of AI systems guided by principles of responsibility, inclusivity, and accessibility.

## Submission Instructions

All teams must submit the following by **12:00 PM on October 5th**:

### Final Presentation:
- Upload your presentation and all relevant materials to the OneDrive folder: [Onedrive](https://utoronto-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jiessie_tie_mail_utoronto_ca/EoRpBto2fWdFnkp9QwbpfJ4B1G-5IgT9hpernV4PgicBFw).
- Ensure that your team folder on OneDrive contains a dedicated folder named "Final Submission," which includes the final version of your presentation and a Google Doc with a detailed account of your design process. The document should describe:
  - Any designs or models you came up with during the hackathon.
  - A thorough breakdown of your thought process, including any changes, challenges, and solutions encountered during development.

### Code Submission:
- Submit your project to GitHub Classroom.
- You are expected to iteratively submit your code, continuously updating your GitHub repository with new iterations of your project throughout the hackathon.
- Ensure that the final working application is included in the repository, along with comprehensive documentation.

### Team Communication:
- Use Slack for team collaboration and updates. All important messages, code snippets, and discussions should be shared through Slack to ensure smooth collaboration.
- Slack invitation link: [Join Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/fairllm-dsi/shared_invite/zt-2rle008qa-432uQK3JyzarTjSJUJ02FA).

Make sure to include your designs, thought processes, and any AI-related models that were used during the hackathon.

## Judging Rubric

Your projects will be evaluated based on the following criteria. Each criterion is broken down into key components, using a 5-point scale (1 = Needs Improvement, 5 = Excellent).
- **Idea Originality**: The project presents a unique and well-defined idea that aligns with the hackathon theme of responsible AI. The idea effectively addresses a challenge or improves upon a current solution. The solution demonstrates clear potential for impact or practicality.
- **Technical Complexity**: The project incorporates at least one AI-driven component to achieve its goals. This category evaluates how technically challenging the solution is and how much the team learned during the development process.
- **Technical Integration**: The system is well-integrated with seamless interactions between its components, including effective use of LLMs. The project is free from significant bugs, and complex AI-driven components are properly handled and functional.
- **Working Demo**:The demo showcases a fully functional system that works smoothly and effectively demonstrates the core features. The demo clearly explains how the system operates and how LLMs contribute to the solution.

If you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to reach out to us on Slack or email Jiessie Tie at [jiessie.tie@mail.utoronto.ca](mailto:jiessie.tie@mail.utoronto.ca).

Happy hacking and good luck! ðŸŽ‰
